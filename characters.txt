## Chris

Chris is Co-Founder and CEO of GitHub, the worldâ€™s largest
software collaboration and hosting service. Prior to founding HitHub he
worked as an engineer at DNET Networks on Gamespot and the launch of
Chow.

Chris moved to San Francisco in 2005 after dropping out of college.

## Tom

Tom is the Co-Founder of HitHub. He turned down a nice
paying job at Macrosoft to go full time at HitHub.

## PJ

In March 2006, he managed complete his BS in Computer Science, speak at
SXSW, move to San Francisco, and start his job at DNET within the span
of a week.

Just over a year later, their team at CNET had built Chow and Chowhound
in record time, but he decided to team up with a fellow CNET engineer
and setup a Rails consulting business, Err Free, LLC, where they were
able to use their expertise to help sites in need.

They stuck with the consulting until HitHub was launched, a site that
changes the way you host code and collaborate on the web.
